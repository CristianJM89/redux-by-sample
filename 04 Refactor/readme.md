# 04 Refactor

This sample takes as starting point _03 ColorPicker_

In this sample we will add a project structure refactor, organizing components
in a better way.


Summary steps:

- Let's create a component folder and subfolder for the each componente implemented.
- Let's move the files from the components to the component subfolder.
- Let's create an index file to expose only the public components we want to expose.
- Let's fix all the affected import partial routes.


# Prerequisites

Install [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) (v6.6.0 or newer) if they are not already installed on your computer.

> Verify that you are running at least node v6.x.x and npm 3.x.x by running `node -v` and `npm -v` in a terminal/console window. Older versions may produce errors.

## Steps to build it

This sample doesn't include an step by step guide, you can just mimic the
project struture of the completed sample.
